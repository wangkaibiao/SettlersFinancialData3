        My Name is Zaid Alyafeai from YEMEN. I am a Master student at KFUPM in Saudi Arabia. I work on machine learning and its applications 
        in computer visions. I like to create my own projects and try to solve them using deep learning. I also like to write about deep learning
        mainly tutorials or notebooks with code. I am mostly active on twitter <a href = "https://twitter.com/zaidalyafeai">@zaidalyafeai</a>. I am open to speaking on conferences or work on part-time projects.

<p> The main purpose of this project is to create a web applications for quick image to image translation.  The implementation is based
    on the paper "Image-to-Image Translation with Conditional Adversarial Networks" by <a href  = "https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.07004">Philip Isola, et al. </a>    . The user can draw a sketch or a semantic map to the left and the application will render it to a real image on the right canvas. 
    The model was trained using Tensorflow and converted to a web application using Tensorflow.js.

<p> The main purpose of this project is to design an application to make face segmentation directly from the webcam. The basic model is a U-Net 
    model extracted from pix2pix trained on this faces <a href = "http://www.mut1ny.com/face-headsegmentation-dataset">dataset</a>. To make sure that the model runs in real time the model was trained with less

<p> In this project the model takes live feed from the webcam and tries to reconstuct the original image. It is based on two models. The first 
    model is based on the face semgnetation project; so basically it creates face segmentation. The second model was trained on a celebrity dataset
    where the input is a segmented face and the output is a celebirty face.

The lower dimension representation is usually called latent space representation.
